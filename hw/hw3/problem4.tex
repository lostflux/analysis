\begin{problem}
  Prove that if $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{p_n} = p$ in a given metric space $(X, d)$,
  then the set of points $S = \set{p, p_1, p_2, \dots}$ is closed.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  \begin{definition}
    A set $S$ is closed if every convergent sequence in $S$ converges to a point in $S$.
  \end{definition}
  
  \step
  Let $\braces{p_i}_1^\infty$ be a convergent sequence in a metric space $(X, d)$
  and $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}{p_i} = p \in X$ as outlined in the problem,
  and let $S = \set{p, p_1, p_2, \dots}$.

  \step
  To show that $S$ is closed, we shall show that any convergent sequence
  in $S$ converges to a point in $S$.
  In fact, we'll make the stronger claim that any such sequence converges to $p$.

  \begin{claim}
    If $Q = \braces{q_i}_1^\infty$ is a convergent sequence in $S$,
    then $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}{q_i} = p$.
    \begin{proof}
      Since $Q$ converges,
      there exists some point $q$ (in $X$, but not necessarily in $S$)
      such that $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}{q_i} = q$.
      
      \step
      Since $\braces{q_i}_1^\infty \subseteq S$, $q_i \in S$ for all $i \in \N$.
      This means that for all $i \in \N$, either $q_i = p$ or $q_i = p_k$ for some $k \in \N$.

      \step
      However, since the sequence $P = \braces{p_i}_1^\infty$ converges to $p$,
      for every $\epsilon > 0$, there are only finitely many $p_i$ such that
      $d(p_i, p) \geq \epsilon$, hence there are only finitely many $q_i$
      such that $d(q_i, p) \geq \epsilon$
      (since each $q_i$ is either equivalent to $p$ or equivalent to $ = p_k$ for some $k \in \N$)
      Thus, for any $\epsilon$, pick $M$ to be the largest such $i$
      in the set of all $i$ such that $d(q_i, p) \geq \epsilon$.
      Then we have $d(q_i, p) < \epsilon$ for all $i \geq M+1$,
      meaning $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}{q_i} = p$.

      \step
      Since $p \in S$, $S$ is closed.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
\end{answer}
