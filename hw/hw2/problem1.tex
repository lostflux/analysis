\begin{problem}
  Let $A$ be a finite set.
  Show that $A$ cannot be an ordered field.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  To show this, we will show that any ordered field must have infinitely many elements.

  \step
  Let $F$ be an ordered field, with $0$ and $1$ as the additive
  and multiplicative identities, and $0 < 1$.

  Recall the following properties of ordered fields:
  \begin{enumarabic}
    \item $0 < 1$
    \item $0 < a < b \implies 0 < a^{-1} < b^{-1}$
    \item $0 < a < b \implies 0 < a + c < b + c$
    \item $0 < a < b \land 0 < c \implies 0 < ac < bc$
  \end{enumarabic}

  \step
  Since $0 < 1$, adding $1$ to both sides implies $1 < 1+1$.
  Repeating this process infinitely many times, we get:
  \begin{align*}
    0 &< 1 \\
    1 &< 1 + 1 \qquad (= 2) \\
    1 + 1 &< 1 + 1 + 1 \qquad (= 3) \\
    1 + 1 + 1 &< 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \qquad (= 4) \\
    &\vdots
  \end{align*}  
  For any element $a \in F$, the element $a + 1$ must be in $F$ (since fields are closed under addition)
  and it must be greater than $a$. Similarly, no addition of two elements
  $a, b$, with $0 < a$ and $0 < b$, can ever equal $0$.
  This can only happen if $F$ is infinite.
