\begin{problem}
  Let $A$ be a finite set.
  Show that $A$ cannot be an ordered field.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  Suppose $A$ is an ordered field,
  with $0$ as the additive identity element, and $1$ as the multiplicative identity element
  such that $0 < 1$.

  \step
  First, note that for any $a \in A$, $a + 1 \in A$,
  and $a \le a + 1$ since $0 < 1$.
  
  Let $a \in A$ be arbitrary.
  Since $A$ is an ordered field, $a + 1 \in A$.
  Since $A$ is an ordered field, $a + 1 > a$.
  
\end{answer}
