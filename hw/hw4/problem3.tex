\begin{problem}
  Show that a complete subspace of a metric space is a closed subset.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  \begin{definition}
    A metric space $X$ is complete if every Cauchy sequence in $X$ converges.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}
    A subset $S$ of a metric space $X$ is closed if it contains all its limit points.
  \end{definition}

  \begin{claim}
    A complete subspace of a metric space is a closed subset.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $X$ be a metric space and $Y \subseteq X$ be a complete subspace of $X$.
      Let $S \subseteq Y$ be a Cauchy sequence in $Y$.
      Since $Y$ is a subspace of $X$, $S$ is also a Cauchy sequence in $X$.
      Since $X$ is complete, $S$ converges in $X$.
      Since $S$ is a Cauchy sequence in $Y$, $S$ converges in $Y$.
      Thus, $Y$ contains all its limit points.
      Thus, $Y$ is closed.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
\end{answer}
