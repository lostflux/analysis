\begin{problem}
  Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space.
  A function $g : X \to \R$ is bounded on $X$
  if $\exists M$ such that $\abs{g(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in X$.

  \step
  Suppose that $f_n : X \to \R$ is bounded on $X$ for each $n \in \N$.
  Show that if a sequence of of $f_n$ converges uniformly
  to a function $f : X \to \R$ then $f$ is bounded on $X$.
