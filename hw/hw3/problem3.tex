\begin{problem}
  Prove that if the points of a convergent sequence of points in a metric space
  are reordered, the new sequence converges to the same limit.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
  Let $\vector{p} = \braces{p_i}_1^\infty$ be a convergent sequence in a metric space $(X, d)$
  such that $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}p_i = p$.\\
  Let $\vector{q} = \braces{q_i}_1^\infty$ be a \emph{re-ordering} of $\vector{p}$ such that for all $i \in \N$,
  $q_i = p_{f(i)}$ for some bijection $f : \N \to \N$.
  We will show that $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}q_i = p$.

  \begin{claim}
    $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}q_i = p$.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary.
      Since $\vector{p}$ converges to $p$, there exists some $N \in \N$ such that
      $d(p_i, p) < \epsilon$ for all $i \geq N$.
      This means that for any such $\epsilon$, there are only finitely many $p_i$ such that
      $d(p_i, p) \geq \epsilon$, i.e. the set
      \[ \set{i \in \N \mid d(p_i, p) \geq \epsilon} \]
      is finite.

      \step
      Since $q_i = p_k$ for some $k \in \N$ for all $i \in \N$
      and the reordering is a bijection,
      the set \[ \set{i \in \N \mid d(q_i, p) \geq \epsilon} \] is also finite.

      \step
      For any $\epsilon$, pick
      \[ M \colonequals \sup \set{i \in \N \mid d(q_i, p) \geq \epsilon}. \]
      Then we have $d(q_i, p) < \epsilon$ for all $i \geq M+1$,
      meaning $\lim\limits_{i \to \infty}q_i = p$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
