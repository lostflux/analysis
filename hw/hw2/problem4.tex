\begin{problem}
  Let $S \colonequals \set{ a_k \given k \in \N} \cup \set{b_k \given k \in \N}$,
  ordered such that $a_k < b_j$ for all $k$ and $j$,
  $a_k < a_m$ whenever $k < m$, and $b_k < b_m$ whenever $k < m$.
  \begin{enumalph}
    \item Show that $S$ is an ordered set.
    \item Show that every subset of $S$ is bounded above and below.
    \item Find a bounded subset of $S$ that has no least upper bound.
