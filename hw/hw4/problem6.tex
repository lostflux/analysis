\begin{problem}
  Prove that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence
  (This statement is known as the \emph{Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem}).

  \emph{
    [Hint]: Construct a Cauchy subsequence from the given sequence
    by constructing a sequence of nested intervals whose length converges to $0$
    and each  interval has infinitely many elements from the original sequence.
