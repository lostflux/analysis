\begin{problem}
  Let $(X, d_X)$ be a metric space.
  A function $g : X \to \R$ is bounded on $X$
  if $\exists M$ such that $\abs{g(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in X$.
  Suppose that $f_n : X \to \R$ is bounded on $X$ for each $n \in \N$.
  Show that if a sequence of of $f_n$ converges uniformly
  to a function $f : X \to \R$ then $f$ is bounded on $X$.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
  We will show that if a sequence of of $f_n$ converges uniformly
  to a function $f : X \to \R$ then $f$ is bounded on $X$.

  \begin{claim}
    If a sequence of of $f_n$ converges uniformly
    to a function $f : X \to \R$ then $f$ is bounded on $X$.
    \begin{proof}
      Since $f_n \to f$ uniformly, for every $\epsilon > 0$,
      there exists an $N \in \N$ such that for all $n \geq N$ and all $x \in X$,
      $\abs{f_n(x) - f(x)} < \epsilon$.
      Since $f_n$ is bounded on $X$ for each $n \in \N$,
      there exists an $M_n$ such that $\abs{f_n(x)} \leq M_n$ for all $x \in X$.
      Let $M = \max \set{M_1, M_2, \ldots, M_N}$.
      Then, for all $x \in X$, $\abs{f(x)} \leq \abs{f(x) - f_N(x)} + \abs{f_N(x)} < \epsilon + M$.
      Since $\epsilon$ is arbitrary, we have $\abs{f(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in X$.
      Thus, $f$ is bounded on $X$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
