\begin{problem}
  Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space.
  Let $A \subset X$.
  Show that $A$ is open if and only if it is equal
  to the union of a collection of open balls.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
  \begin{definition}
    A set $A \subset X$ is open if each point in $A$ has an open ball
    contained in $A$.
  \end{definition}

  \step
  Let $A$ be an open set.
  Then, by definition, each point in $A$ has some open ball contained in $A$.
  Let $B$ be the union of all such open balls.
  
  \begin{claim}
    $A \subseteq B$.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $a \in A$ be arbitrary.
      Since $A$ is an open set, $a$ has some open ball $\ball{r}{a}$ contained in $A$.
      This ball must contain $a$ itself, and since $B$ is the union of all such open balls,
      $B$ must also contain $a$. Therefore, $a \in B$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}

  \begin{claim}
    $A \supseteq B$.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $b \in B$ be arbitrary.
      Since $B$ is the union of a collection of open balls contained in
      $A$, the point $b$ must be in some open ball contained in $A$.
      Therefore, $b$ itself must also be in $A$, so $b \in A$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}

  \step
  Since $A \subseteq B$ and $A \supseteq B$, $A = B$.
\end{answer}
