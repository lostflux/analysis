\begin{problem}
  Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $A \subset X$.
  The closure of $A$ is the set
  \[
    \overline{A} \colonequals \bigcap \set{
      E \subset X \given \text{$E$ is closed and $A \subset E$}
    }.
  \]
  Assume $A$ is a connected set.
  Is $\overline{A}$ connected?
  Prove or find a counterexample.
\end{problem}

\begin{answer}
  $\overline{A}$ is connected.
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose, for contradiction, that $\overline{A}$ is not connected.
    Then, there exist nonempty disjoint sets $U, V \subset X$ such that:
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item $\overline{A} = U \cup V$~\label{item:1}
      \item $\overline{A} \cap U \neq \emptyset$~\label{item:2}
      \item $\overline{A} \cap V \neq \emptyset$~\label{item:3}
      \item $U \cap V = \emptyset$~\label{item:4}
    \end{enumarabic}
    By the definition of $\overline{A}$, $A \subseteq \overline{A}$
    (since $\overline{A}$ is a union of closed sets containing $A$).
    Then, by \ref{item:1}, $A \subseteq U \cup V$. \\
    But since $A$ is connected, $A$ must be fully contained in either $U$ or $V$
    since $U$ and $V$ are disjoint(by~\ref{item:4}).
    \begin{enumarabic}
      \item If $A \subseteq U$, then for any $a \in A$, $a \in U$
        and $a \not \in V$. \\
        But, by~\ref{item:3}, $\overline{A} \cap V \neq \emptyset$,
        so there must be some element $v \in V$ such that $v \in \overline{A}$.
        This implies that $v$ is contained in every closed set containing $A$,
        so $v$ is contained in $U$, which is a contradiction of the fact that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

      \item If $A \subseteq V$, then for any $a \in A$, $a \in V$
        and $a \not \in U$. \\
        But, by~\ref{item:2}, $\overline{A} \cap U \neq \emptyset$,
        so there must be some element $u \in U$ such that $u \in \overline{A}$.
        This implies that $u$ is contained in every closed set containing $A$,
        so $u$ is contained in $V$, which is a contradiction of the fact that $U \cap V = \emptyset$.

    \end{enumarabic}
    Therefore, $\overline{A}$ is connected.
    
  \end{proof}
