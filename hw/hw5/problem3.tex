\begin{problem}
  Let $U, V$ be open intervals in $\R$,
  and let $f : U \to V$ be a function that is strictly increasing
  (i.e. if $x, y \in U$ and $x < y$, then $f(x) < f(y)$) and onto.
  Prove that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{claim}
      $f$ is continuous.
      \begin{proof}
        Let $x_0 \in U$.
        Let $\epsilon > 0$.
        Since $f$ is onto, there exists $y_0 \in V$ such that $f(x_0) = y_0$.
        Since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
        $f(x_0 - \delta) < y_0 - \epsilon$ and $f(x_0 + \delta) > y_0 + \epsilon$.
        Therefore, $f(B_\delta(x_0)) \subseteq B_\epsilon(y_0)$.
        Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ for all $x_0 \in U$.
      \end{proof}
    \end{claim}

    \begin{claim}
      $f^{-1}$ is continuous.
      \begin{proof}
        Let $y_0 \in V$.
        Let $\epsilon > 0$.
        Since $f$ is onto, there exists $x_0 \in U$ such that $f(x_0) = y_0$.
        Since $f$ is strictly increasing, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
        $f(x_0 - \delta) < y_0 - \epsilon$ and $f(x_0 + \delta) > y_0 + \epsilon$.
        Therefore, $f(B_\delta(x_0)) \subseteq B_\epsilon(y_0)$.
        Therefore, $f^{-1}$ is continuous at $y_0$ for all $y_0 \in V$.
      \end{proof}
    \end{claim}
  \end{answer}
