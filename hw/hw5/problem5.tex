\begin{problem}
  Let $a, b \in \R$, $a < b$, and let $f : [a, b] \to \R$ be a continuous function.
  Prove that if $f$ is one-to-one then $f([a, b])$ is either
  $[f(a), f(b)]$ or $[f(b), f(a)]$ (whichever expression makes sense).
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  \begin{claim}
    If $f$ is one-to-one then $f([a, b])$ is either
    $[f(a), f(b)]$ or $[f(b), f(a)]$.
    \begin{proof}
      We will show that $f([a, b])$ is an interval. \\
      Let $x_0, x_1 \in [a, b]$ with $x_0 < x_1$,
      and let $y_0 = f(x_0)$ and $y_1 = f(x_1)$.
      \begin{enumarabic}
        \item Since $f$ is continuous, by the intermediate value theorem,
          for any $y \in [\min\set{y_0, y_1}, \max\set{y_0, y_1}]$
          there exists some $x \in [x_0, x_1]$ such that $f(x) = y$.
          Thus, $f$ takes on every value in $[\min\set{y_0, y_1}, \max\set{y_0, y_1}]$.
        \item Since $f$ is injective, $x_a \neq x_b$ implies $y_a \neq y_b$.
          This means that $f$ does not repeat any values over the interval
          $[x_0, x_1]$, so $[\min\set{y_0, y_1}, \max\set{y_0, y_1}]$
          is also an interval.
      \end{enumarabic}
      By setting $x_0 = a$ and $x_1 = b$,
      we have $f([a, b]) = [\min\set{f(a), f(b)}, \max\set{f(a), f(b)}]$.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
