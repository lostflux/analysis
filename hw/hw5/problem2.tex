\begin{problem}
  Let $E, E'$ be metric spaces, $f : E \to E'$ be a function,
  and suppose that $S_1$ and $S_2$ are subsets of $E$
  such that $S_1 \cup S_2 = E$.
  Show that if the restrictions of $f$ to $S_1$ and $S_2$ are continuous,
  then $f$ is continuous.

  \begin{answer}
    \begin{claim}
      If the restrictions of $f$ to $S_1$ and $S_2$ are continuous,
      then $f$ is continuous.
      \begin{proof}
        Let $x_0 \in E$.
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item Case 1: $x_0 \in S_1$.
            Since $\restr{f}{S_1}$ is continuous, $\displaystyle \lim_{x \to x_0}{f(x)} = f(x_0)$.
          \item Case 2: $x_0 \in S_2$.
            Since $\restr{f}{S_2}$ is continuous, $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to x_0}{f(x)} = f(x_0)$.
        \end{enumerate}
        Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ for all $x_0 \in E$.
      \end{proof}
    \end{claim}
  \end{answer}
