\begin{problem}
  Let $(E, d)$ and $(E', d')$ be metric spaces, $f : E \to E'$ be a function,
  and let $p \in E$. Define the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ to be
  \[
    \inf \set{
      a \in \R \given
      \text{
        $\exists$ open ball in $B_r(p) \in E$
        such that $\forall x, y \in B_r(p)$,
        $d'(f(x), f(y)) \leq a$
      }
    } \]
    if the set is nonempty, and $+\infty$ otherwise.
    Prove that $f$ is continuous at $p$ if and only if the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is $0$,
    and that for any real number $\epsilon$, the set of points of $E$
    at which the oscillation of $f$ is at least $\epsilon$ is closed.
\end{problem}
\begin{answer}
  \begin{claim}
    $f$ is continuous at $p$ if and only if the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is $0$.
    \begin{proof}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item ($\Rightarrow$)
          Suppose $f$ is continuous at $p$.
          Let $\epsilon > 0$.
          Then there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
          for all $x \in E$ with $d(x, p) < \delta$,
          $d'(f(x), f(p)) < \epsilon$.
          Therefore, the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is at most $\epsilon$.
          Since $\epsilon > 0$ was arbitrary, the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is $0$.
        \item ($\Leftarrow$)
          Suppose the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is $0$.
          Let $\epsilon > 0$.
          Then there exists $\delta > 0$ such that
          for all $x \in E$ with $d(x, p) < \delta$,
          $d'(f(x), f(p)) < \epsilon$.
          Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $p$.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}

  \begin{claim}
    For any real number $\epsilon$, the set of points of $E$
    at which the oscillation of $f$ is at least $\epsilon$ is closed.
    \begin{proof}
      Let $A \colonequals \set{p \in E \given \text{oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is at least $\epsilon$}}$.
      We shall show that $A$ is closed.
      Let $p \in E \setminus A$.
      Then the oscillation of $f$ at $p$ is less than $\epsilon$.
      Let $a \in \R$ such that $a < \epsilon$.
      Then there exists an open ball $B_r(p)$ in $E$ such that
      for all $x, y \in B_r(p)$, $d'(f(x), f(y)) \leq a$.
      Therefore, $B_r(p) \subseteq E \setminus A$.
      Therefore, $E \setminus A$ is open, so $A$ is closed.
    \end{proof}
  \end{claim}
